title: "Occupational hazard: Inequalities in occupational mismatch"
summary: "
In this paper we provide a new metric and framework to describe the extent of occupational mismatch 
in a labor market. We do so by constructing a single dimensional continuous measure of ability for 
individuals, and two distinct measures of occupational quality. This allows us to examine the extent to 
which young people mismatch into occupations that are higher or lower ranked than they could achieve 
and explore whether there are systematic differences in the nature of match by key demographics, 
including socio-economic status (SES) and gender. We find inefficiencies in the match between young 
peoples’ achievement ranking and their occupation ranking, and large socio-economic inequalities in 
education-based and earnings-based match, across the achievement distribution. We also find large 
gender gaps in earnings-based match, with women working in jobs that are significantly lower ranked 
than their male counterparts, but similarly ranked in terms of education-based match. While educational 
routes between compulsory education and occupations at age 25 can explain around 33% of these SES 
gaps among high achievers, a sizeable difference in undermatch remains for high achieving low SES 
students (8 percentiles), when taking into account all post-16 activity. The gender gap in mismatch 
remains stable, suggesting that education choices are not responsible for the large differences observed 
between men and women. Instead, the type of industry worked in can account for almost 76% of the 
gender gap among low achievers, although a significant difference still remains between men and 
women.
