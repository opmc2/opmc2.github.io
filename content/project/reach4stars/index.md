title: "Reach for the stars: Inequalities in university applications by school type"
summary: "
A growing body of research has shown large SES gaps in the match between
students and their courses, with students from disadvantaged backgrounds more
likely to 'undermatch' by attending less selective university courses than their entry
grades would permit. In this paper we examine the role of university application
behaviour in explaining these gaps. We find that individuals from different schools
have very different application profiles, with those from independent schools much
more likely to make 'reach' applications. In general, these reach applications are
successful, and thus largely explain the why those from independent schools appear
to be more likely to enrol in more selective courses, even when their entry grades
are similar to those from the state sector.
