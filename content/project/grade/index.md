title: "Exploring SES, gender and ethnicity gaps in teacher judgements and the implications for university participation"
summary: "
We determine whether teachers have systematically under- or over-predicted some groups of secondary school students following the cancellation of exams in 2020, and the consequences for their university destinations. 
We are also interested in what we can learn from this more generally: teachers are widely recognised as the most important determinant of student outcomes within the educational setting. 
Thus if teachers did award some types of students more generous predictions, this information could help us to understand the consequences of existing and potential policies which involve teachers’ subjective evaluations of students (e.g. university applications).
