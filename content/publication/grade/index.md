title: "Measuring systematic gaps in teacher judgement: A new approach"
summary: "
*NEW WP COMING SOON!!*
Do teachers mark some pupils more generously than others? We propose a new approach to tackle this longstanding question by exploiting a unique situation where teachers were required to assign students both grades and rankings within each grade. Comparing students on either side of grade boundaries, we apply local randomization --- an extension of the RDD framework --- to detect imbalance in student characteristics. Our findings reveal systematic bias favoring higher income, female, and white pupils. These grading decisions carry real consequences: students just above the grade threshold are significantly more likely to attend university and secure their first-choice degree.
